Hi, this is Tom.

I grew up in Beijing, China, attended RDFZ (High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China) for high school, and I'm now an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I speak English and Mandarin, and I'm currently learning French (natural languages); I primarily program in Python and Java (programming languages). During my spare time, I like to play video games, watch documentaries, science fiction, and alternate history fiction. I used to play the piano and ski years ago, and I'm planning to restart these activities in the near future!

I’m currently enrolled in the Astronomy and Physics Specialist program at the University of Toronto, St. George and have been actively engaged in research and coursework. Recognizing the importance of Computer Science in modern astrophysics research, I am concurrently pursuing a Computer Science major with a focus on scientific computing alongside the Specialist program. Besides research and coursework, I'm also actively participating in outreach events such as AstroTours volunteering. 

In the summer of 2023, I spent three months at I-FIM, National University of Singapore for a research exchange. My project focused on building the software and hardware that enable the automatic mapping and recognition of exfoliated 2D materials. In the 2023-24 academic year, I completed a Supervised Study Project in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the COOLS group, University of Toronto. My project focused on understanding black hole populations with gravitational waves and gamma-ray bursts. During the summer of 2024, I will be doing a Supervised Study Project in astroparticle physics at the SuperCDMS group, University of Toronto. For the 2024-25 academic year, I'm planning to continue my research in gravitational waves at the COOLS group as my Honours Thesis project.

I’m approaching the end of my degree and planning to apply for graduate school with a Fall 2025 entry; my final goal is a Ph.D. My interest lies in astronomy and astrophysics, especially in the studies of gravitational waves. If you're available to connect, please let me know!
