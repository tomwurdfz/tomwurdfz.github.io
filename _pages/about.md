Hi, this is Tom.

I grew up in Beijing, China, went to RDFZ(High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China) for High school and I'm now an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I speak English and Mandarin and I'm currently learning French(Natural Languages), I mainly write Python and Java(Programming Languages).

Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the Astronomy and Physics Specialist program at UofT St. George and have been actively 
engaged in research and coursework. Recognizing the importance of Computer Science in modern Astrophysics research, I am concurrently 
pursuing a Computer Science Major with a focus on Scientific Computing alongside the Specialist program. Besides research and coursework, I'm also actively participating in outreach events such as AstroTours Volunteering.

In 2023, I spent 3 months at the National University of Singapore doing a research project by building the Software and Hardware that enables the automatic 
mapping and recognition of exfoliated 2D materials. I'm currently doing a research project that focuses on Understanding Black Hole Populations with Gravitational Waves and Gamma-Ray Burst.
