Hi, this is Tom.

I grew up in Beijing, China, attended RDFZ (High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China) for high school, and I'm now an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I speak English and Mandarin, and I'm currently learning French (natural languages); I primarily program in Python and Java (programming languages). During my spare time, I like to play video games, watch documentaries, science fiction, and alternate history fiction. I used to play the piano and ski years ago, and I'm planning to restart these activities in the near future!

I’m currently enrolled in the Astronomy and Physics Specialist program at the University of Toronto, St. George and have been actively engaged in research and coursework. Recognizing the importance of Computer Science in modern astrophysics research, I am concurrently pursuing a Computer Science major with a focus on scientific computing alongside the Specialist program. Besides research and coursework, I'm also actively participating in outreach events such as AstroTours volunteering. 

I’m currently applying for graduate schools where my final goal is a Ph.D. in astronomy and physics.  I’m committed to exploring the universe’s most violent interactions through techniques like gravitational waves, simulations, and data analysis.
